# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction

Introduction:

The Big Mart Sales Prediction project aims to predict the sales of various products in Big Mart outlets using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes a dataset that provides information about different products and their attributes, such as weight, visibility, type, and other relevant factors. The dataset includes historical sales data, which will be used to develop a predictive model to forecast future sales.

In the retail industry, accurately predicting sales is crucial for effective inventory management, supply chain optimization, and overall business planning. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to provide insights into factors that influence product sales and create a reliable model for sales prediction.

The dataset includes a wide range of features, such as product identifiers, store information, product weights, and store-specific variables. These features will serve as independent variables for the regression analysis, while the sales of each product will be the target variable to be predicted.

Throughout the project, various data preprocessing techniques will be applied to clean and transform the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables. Machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests will be employed to train and evaluate models for accurate sales predictions.

The ultimate goal of the Big Mart Sales Prediction project is to provide a robust and accurate sales prediction model that can assist store managers and stakeholders in making informed decisions about inventory management, promotional strategies, and sales forecasting. The project's code, documentation, and evaluation metrics will be available in the GitHub repository for further reference and transparency.
